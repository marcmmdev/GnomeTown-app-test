# Welcome to Brastlewark, heroes!

GnomeTown is a little application that helps heroes to search and see the profile of all the gnomes living in Brastlewark.

## Getting Started

The application has been tested in Android Studio latest version (3.00) - you can duplicate the repository and execute the APP in your favorite simulator/device.

## Running the tests

There isn't any test implemented yet. 

- There should be, at least, an unitary test on the JSON fetch to check if the method is capable of managing all the data coming from the server, which is, essentially, the core of the app.

## Built With

- Java
- https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView
